# Developer-Console-Game
A RPG Game that is only accessible from the Developers Console. This is also an automatic game(no input)

You can play the game by pressing CTRL + SHIFT + J in Chrome to access
the developers console.

All the code has to be in one file because this was just for an assignment for school. I couldn't get too complex as I am not allowed and there is a limit on i'm allowed to do.
